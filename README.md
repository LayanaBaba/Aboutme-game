**Reflections and Comments**

* >How did this go, overall?
 It went well.

* >What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
 What I learned is very difficult and needs hard work.

* >How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
 I expected it to take half an hour, but it took two hours of hard work.
