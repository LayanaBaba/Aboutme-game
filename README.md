**About Me, with a guessing game**

I built this website because it was required of me in code 201. This website contain seven question, five of them is a yes/y or no/n questions. And the question number 6 is a guessing number game with 4 attempt. The last question is to guess something about me with 6 attempts.

 What I learned is very difficult and needs hard work.
